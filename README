This project is the coolest ever!

Next Steps
 - Review my comments in ContactBook
 - Finish the methods that add/remove entries into the contact book
 - Add a method called save() that will save the List of Person objects to a file
 - Add a method called load() that will read the file and populate the list of person objects.
 
 For Fun
 - Try out a couple different ways to sort the list before printing it.
 
 NOTE : 
 - don't put .class files into a repository.  More general - don't put any compiled resources into a repo.
